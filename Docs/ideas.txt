Ideas:

*) Config arrangment of flowboxes in selector tabs.

*) Move regions between pages.


Possible bugs (check):

*) Is OnDragEnds triggered if one sets EnableInout(false)?

Notes:


Possible Changes:
Move Strata/Layer stuff off strings onto numeric indizies.

SetVertexColor -> SetTextureColor

Rotation:

Check:
What happens if string gets new properties (SetFont,...) is it correctly updated?

Texture:SetVertexColor
----------------------
TODO: should be more indicative of it being a solid color? Consider getting rid of,
as VertexColor and SetTexture duplicate functionality. 

Note: I agree with this but don't want to rework this just now. The "right" thing is to have
a simple wrapper like SetColor() that sets color of all 4 points. Make empty texture Texture() default to be plain.
Also simplify the Gradient calls to calls that allow to set colors at each vertex. For a future revision I'd say.
